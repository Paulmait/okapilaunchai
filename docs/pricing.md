# OkapiLaunch AI — Competitive Pricing (Founder-ready)

OkapiLaunch AI is **not** “multi-model access”. It’s an **outcome engine**:
App Store–ready iOS apps + compliance + assets + export pipeline.

## Pricing principles
- Charge for **shipping**, not tokens.
- Keep vibe coders inside the ecosystem: prompt → build → fix → export → TestFlight checklist.
- Bundle compliance + screenshots (these are high-value for App Review success).
- Add a “done-for-you” lane for agencies.

## Recommended tiers (USD)

### 1) Launch (Pay-per-ship)
- **$39 per export**
- Includes: project wizard, plan + legal + screenshot spec + downloadable export.zip
- Best for: vibe coders validating ideas quickly
- Rate limits: fair-use (e.g., 3 exports/day)

### 2) Builder (Subscription)
- **$79/month**
- Includes: unlimited projects, 30 exports/month, regeneration + fix loop, versioned exports
- Best for: indie founders shipping repeatedly

### 3) Studio (Teams / Agencies)
- **$299/month**
- Includes: 5 seats, 150 exports/month, template library, client-ready packaging, priority queue

### 4) Enterprise / White-label

- **“Pass Review” Compliance Pack**: $29/app (privacy nutrition label + delete-my-data flow verification)

## Competitive angle vs “multi-AI for a fee”
Competitors sell model choices. OkapiLaunch sells:
- structured intake
- deterministic outputs
- compliance guardrails
- a one-click export
